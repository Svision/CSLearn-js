    <!------- Loading JS scripts ------->
    <!-- When loading JS scripts, considerations should be made regarding when
         the DOM is being loaded, and when different scripts 
         depend on each other. Below are a few ways to load the scripts.
     -->

     <!-- Load any CSS before the JS in case you need to access styles in your scripts. -->

   	<!-- If you don't use either 'async' or 'defer', the HTML parsing/DOM loading is blocked until the script is downloaded and executed. -->
    <!-- Since it is the top script on the page, it will block 
      before loading everything under it (including the <body>).  -->
    <script src="dom_load.js"></script>
    

    <!-- 'defer' states that the script should be executed after the HTML is parsed.
         If multiple scripts have 'defer', they are loaded one after the other.  
         This will guarantee execution order, and ensure that scripts that depend on each other load
         in an order that will not cause errors. -->
    <!-- First we load jquery from a Google CDN. -->
    <script defer src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script defer src="CSLearn.js"></script>
    <!-- Then we load a script that depends on jQuery -->
    <script defer src='./data_structures/csl.array/index.js'></script>
    <script defer src='./data_structures/csl.linkedList/index.js'></script>
    <script defer src='./algorithms/csl.binarySearch/index.js'></script>
    <script defer src='./data_structures/csl.queue/index.js'></script>
    <script defer src='./data_structures/csl.stack/index.js'></script>
    <script defer src='./algorithms/csl.selectionSort/index.js'></script>

    <script defer src='examples.js'></script>

    <!-- 
    - 'async' states that it is safe to download the script without blocking 
    HTML parsing, and execute  once downloaded (DOM loading, if not completed, pauses during script execution).
    This allows for quicker loading of the DOM content while waiting for scripts to download.
    Note that if multiple scripts are 'async', their order
    of loading is *not* guaratneed, and async scripts may also be executed after 
    the 'DOMContentLoaded' event is fired (we make up for this in the dom_load_async.js file).
    * General rule: don't use async on scripts that depend on each other. *
     Often scripts like ads and analytics are loaded async since they don't depend
     on other scipts.
